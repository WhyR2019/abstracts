# Description

In this presentation you’ll learn how to build Natural Language Processing(NLP) models with the quanteda package. You will also learn how to deliver NLP technology to non-programming analysts by creating a Shiny interface.
Natural Language Processing has become a significant field in applications - customer claim automation, detecting fake news, voice assistants, and social media bots are all NLP work results. The possibility of accessing massive text collections, the rapid development of computational power and emerging tools mean that this field will continue to enjoy great popularity and development. An excellent example of such a tool is Quanteda - an R language package for quantitative analysis of textual data and the winner of the 2018 SAGE Concept Grant.

During the presentation, we will familiarize the audience with the possibilities of Quanteda and present interesting results of a model that was built using it. In the second part, we will tell you what steps we have taken to bring the world of NLP closer to people interested in the field who are not necessarily programmers. More specifically, we will tell you about the Quanteda Graphical User Interface (GUI) project - a web application that opens the door to new communities of users to start their own  NLP projects. In this part, you will have the opportunity to learn about the current state of work on the project, and you’ll find out what problems need to be addressed when implementing such solutions.
