# Always Be Deploying. How to make R great for machine learning in (not only) Enterprise.

Author: Wit Jakuczun (WLOG Solutions)

# Description

For many years software engineers have put enormous effort to develop best practices to deliver stable and maintainable software. How R users can benefit from this experience? I will try to answer this question going through several concepts and tools that are natural for software engineers but are often undervalued by R users. 

I will start with a description of the deployment process because this is the ultimate step that exposes all weaknesses. You will learn about structuring R project, using abstractions to manage model’s features, automating models building process, optimizing the performance of the solution and the challenges of the deployment process itself.
